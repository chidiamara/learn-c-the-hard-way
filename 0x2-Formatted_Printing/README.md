# Exercise 3. Formatted Printing

First we're including another header file called `stdio.h`. This tells the compiler that you're going to use the standard Input/Output functions. One of those is `printf`.

Then we're using a variable named `age` and setting it to 10.

Next we're using a variable `height` and setting it to 72.

Then we're adding the `printf` function to print the age and height of the tallest 10-year-old on the planet.

In `printf`, you'll notice we're including a format string, as seen in many other languages.

After this format string, we're putting in the variables that should be "replaced" into the format string by `printf`.

The result is giving `printf` some variables and it's constructing a new string and then printing it to the terminal.
